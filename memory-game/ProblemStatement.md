Create a card matching game to test the player's memory.

Requirements

    Cards should be laid out on a 6x6 grid, all face down initially (i.e. numbers not showing)
    There should be a total of 36 cards with the numbers 1-18 (two of each), placed randomly on the grid
    Clicking a card should 'reveal' it - showing the hidden number of the card
    Clicking a second card should reveal that card
    If the second card has the same number as the first card, both cards should be removed from the board after 3 seconds
    If the second card has a different number to the first card, both cards should be 'hidden' again after 3 seconds (i.e. turned face down)
    The user shouldn't be able to turn over any more cards until the 3 second timer completes and the two revealed cards are either removed (if they matched), or hidden again (if they didn't)
    Once all cards are removed from the board, the game is over and the 'Play again' button should be shown
    Clicking 'Play again' should generate a new, random set of cards on the grid
